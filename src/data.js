    title: "Octane",
    desc: "The Octane hitbox dominates the RLCS scene due to its versatility and favorable stats, making it the preferred choice for pros. With a height of 36.16 uu, the second tallest in the game, it excels in 50/50s and kickoffs, leveraging its height and slightly above-average width for superior challenges and powerful nose shots. While adept at mechanics like flicks and redirects, it’s less specialized in these areas compared to other hitboxes. Its main drawback lies in aerial reach, with a height of 118.01 uu, which can limit effectiveness in the air, though its solid width and ground prowess compensate. Overall, its well-rounded performance and consistency solidify its place as the go-to choice in professional play.",

    title: "Dominus",
    desc: "The Dominus hitbox is a versatile option favored for its aerial prowess and unique strengths. With a downward slope of -0.96 degrees, it excels at generating powerful flicks, giving players the potential for deadly offensive plays. However, this same power can work against you if the ball rebounds unfavorably. On the ground, the Dominus's low height and narrower width make it more vulnerable in challenges and 50/50s, requiring precision and careful positioning. Despite these challenges, the Dominus thrives in the air. Its notable length, nearly eight Unreal Units longer than the Octane, allows for consistent contact during mechanics like redirects and double taps, making it a staple in freestyling clips. Freestyle icon JZR has showcased the sheer capability of the Dominus in creating powerful and creative plays, reinforcing its dominance in aerial scenarios.",

    title: "Breakout",
    desc: "The Breakout hitbox, while less common, is an exceptional choice for players specializing in advanced aerial mechanics. It features the same steep angle as the Dominus, with a slope of -0.98 degrees, making it equally formidable for generating powerful flicks. On the ground, the Breakout shares similar disadvantages with the Dominus, being less effective in challenges due to its low height and width. However, it stands out in the air as the longest car in the game at 131.49 Unreal Units. This extraordinary length makes it the preferred choice for executing mechanics like flip resets, as the extended surface area provides a larger margin for precise contact. Freestyler Ganer has demonstrated the Breakout's unparalleled capability, chaining together an incredible fifteen flip resets in a single sequence. With its unmatched aerial potential, the Breakout hitbox shines as a top choice for freestylers looking to push the boundaries of creativity and skill.",

    title: "Hybrid",
    desc: "The Hybrid hitbox is a versatile choice, blending the strengths of multiple hitbox types to create a balanced option for both casual and competitive play. With a length of 127.02 uu, it approaches the Dominus in reach, offering excellent aerial control, while its height of 34.16 uu surpasses the Dominus, making it more reliable in 50/50 challenges. Its respectable width and the same angle as the Octane hitbox allow for powerful flicks and consistent ground control. While it doesn’t exceed the Octane in maneuverability or the Dominus in aerial specialization, the Hybrid hitbox excels as a middle ground, making it an ideal choice for players seeking a balance between the two. Popularized by cars like the ‘99 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34, the Hybrid hitbox is a strong and forgiving option for both high-level and freestyle gameplay.",

    title: "Plank",
    desc: "The Plank hitbox, known for its exceptional length (128.82 uu) and unmatched width (84.67 uu), excels in ground plays and aerial maneuvers, making it a unique choice for skilled players. Its massive surface area enables precise dribbling, versatile flicks, and rapid directional changes that outplay opponents, while its low angle enhances ball control and power generation on flicks. Players like kuxir97 and Fairy Peak! have demonstrated its potential in competitive settings, particularly with the ‘16 Batmobile. However, its low height (29.39 uu) poses challenges in 50/50s and defensive situations, as the ball can easily pass over or under the car if not perfectly centered. Despite these weaknesses, mastery of the Plank hitbox unlocks immense potential for creative and dominant gameplay.",

    title: "Merc",
    desc: "The Merc hitbox, introduced in September 2020, stands out for its towering height of 41.66 uu, making it the tallest hitbox in the game and a powerhouse in 50/50 challenges. Its height gives it a significant vertical advantage, allowing for effective ball control during dribbles, as the ball is less likely to drop. However, its thin width makes lateral challenges riskier and reduces the surface area for precise shots or adjustments. The Merc's length is among the shortest, which slightly hinders its aerial and flick capabilities. Additionally, its unique positive angle—where the front is higher than the back—makes flicks more awkward to execute, as the ball may gain natural backward velocity, but it provides maximum height at the front for dominant 50/50s. While its unconventional specs may require adjustment, the Merc hitbox is a viable alternative for those seeking a fresh yet powerful option.",
